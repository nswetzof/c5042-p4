/**
 * @class TCPServer this class is intended to only be used as a base class for
 *                  an application-defined server. It is a simple server that only
 *                  accepts a _single_ client and then after conversing with that client,
 *                  exits.
 *                  The application's subclass is intended to implement overrides of
 *                  two protected methods: start_client() and process():
 *                    o  The start_client() method is called after the clients connection has
 *                       been established.
 *                    o  The process() method is called after every recv() from the client.
 *                    o  The respond() method is available for replies to be sent to the
 *                       client as desired by the subclass.
 *
 *                  Construction creates the server and initializes the socket. The serve()
 *                  method actually starts listening (and will block internally waiting for
 *                  the client). It also blocks in serve() waiting for more recv() calls to
 *                  finish. The server will exit the inter serve() loop if the process() method
 *                  returns false.
 *
 *                  Failures will be thrown as std::runtime_error.
